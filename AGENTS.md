# OpenCode Behavior Rules

## Mutation Approval Rule

Before performing *any mutation* (editing, modifying, deleting, patching, writing, creating files, etc.):

1. Summarize what will be changed in clear English.
2. Ask: "Do you approve these changes?"
3. Wait for my explicit yes/no response.
4. Do NOT apply changes without explicit approval.
